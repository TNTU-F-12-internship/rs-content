Companies that want to achieve business results faster and enter new markets are well aware of the need to use limited 
resources efficiently. Thanks to cloud solutions for business, the flow of information within the organization becomes 
smoother, which significantly improves daily work. A single and effective collaboration environment allows you to share 
resources and work on different tasks simultaneously.

Case studies - the best practices of effective transformation of business processes, development of modern technologies 
and their use for the needs of the company.

#### Incompatibility of disparate solutions

The use of various independent programs for e-mail, scheduling or document editing leads to problems due to the lack of 
compatibility between different small tools and as a result of significant duplication of data. Sometimes individual 
departments use software that is incompatible with solutions that favor other teams, resulting in leaky ways of 
communicating internally. Also, different file formats and methods of sharing them can lead to significant 
misunderstandings.

##### Solution

With an integrated set of tools, you can abandon all old programs and create a holistic working environment with 
universal login support for many integrated services. Such an integrated environment will allow businesses to grow 
faster, thanks to joint event planning, uniform data processing and a single communication environment.

#### System access security

It is important for every business to block the ability to log in outside the organization. To do this, you need to 
increase the reliability and security of e-mail, in particular through tracking and detection of suspicious logins. 
At the same time, companies often use different incompatible tools, which further complicates the process of setting 
up access.

##### Solution

Special administrator settings in the integrated desktop allow you to block access to files outside the organization. 
One administrator has complete control over the accounts and this saves a lot of time for the technical department. 
The administrator can also easily control password strength, user activity, and give employees access to specific files. 
Such a system is managed centrally and at the same time accessible to workers who work around the globe and have access 
to the Internet.

#### Not enough storage space

Every company understands the importance of efficient and fast information exchange. Often this exchange takes place 
via e-mail or flash drives. By sending dozens of e-mails a day with attachments, employees do not have enough space to 
store them. Such an inefficient data exchange system leads to duplication of files and rapid accumulation of such copies 
on different devices.

##### Solution

Storing files in an unlimited space in the cloud solves space problems on employees' computers. Using cloud services, 
employees can quickly and easily share a single copy of documents with each other and use unlimited space to store them. 
This level of freedom gives businesses unlimited opportunities for growth.

#### File sharing and collaboration

When data is stored in different places, important files are sometimes lost or difficult to find. Sometimes there are 
situations when several employees work with one document. Several versions of the same file undergo different additional 
changes, which makes them unequal and complicates further work. Such situations require additional time to compile all 
copies into one current version.

##### Solution

Using cloud services to store files allows you to realize the benefits of sharing. Employees can access the required 
documents from any device and at any time. File editors are available in both the browser and mobile applications. 
This enables real-time collaboration, speeds up tasks, and simplifies internal communication.
