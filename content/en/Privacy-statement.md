### Introduction 

We (“Rework-Space”, “us”, or “our”) are  strongly committed to protecting personal data.  This transparency notice 
describes why and how we collect and use personal data and provides information about individuals’ rights.  We may use 
personal data provided to us for any of the purposes described in this transparency notice or as otherwise stated at 
the point of collection.

Personal data is any information relating to an identified or identifiable living person.  Rework-Space processes 
personal data for numerous purposes, and the means of collection, lawful basis of processing, use, disclosure, and 
retention periods for each purpose may differ.

When collecting and using personal data, our policy is to be transparent about why and how we process personal data.  

### Security 

We take the security of all the data we hold very seriously.  We adhere to internationally recognised security 
standards.  We have a framework of policies, procedures and training in place covering data protection, confidentiality 
and security and regularly review the appropriateness of the measures we have in place to keep the data we hold secure.

### Our processing activities 

To find out more please go to the sections of this statement that are relevant to you.

## Visitors to our website

### Collection of personal data 

Visitors to our websites are generally in control of the personal data shared with us. We may capture limited personal 
data automatically via the use of cookies on our website. Please see the section on Cookies below for more information.

We receive personal data, such as name, title, company address, email address, and telephone and fax numbers, from 
website visitors; for example when an individual subscribes to updates from us.

Visitors are also able to send an email to us through the website. Their messages will contain the user’s screen name 
and email address, as well as any additional information the user may wish to include in the message.

We ask that you do not provide sensitive information (such as race or ethnic origin; political opinions; religious or 
philosophical beliefs; trade union membership; physical or mental health; genetic data; biometric data; sexual life or 
sexual orientation; and, criminal records) to us when using our website; if you choose to provide sensitive information 
to us for any reason, the act of doing so constitutes your explicit consent for us to collect and use that information 
in the ways described in this privacy statement or as described at the point where you choose to disclose this 
information.

### Cookies

We use small text files called ‘cookies’ which are placed on your hard drives to assist in personalising and enriching 
your browsing experience by displaying content that is more likely to be relevant and of interest to you. The use of 
cookies is now standard operating procedure for most websites.  However if you are uncomfortable with the use of 
cookies, most browsers now permit users to opt-out of receiving them. You need to accept cookies in order register on 
our website.  You may find other functionality in the website impaired if you disable cookies. After termination of 
the visit to our site, you can always delete the cookie from your system if you wish.

### Use of personal data

When a visitor provides personal data to us, we will use it for the purposes for which it was provided to us as stated 
at point of collection (or as obvious from the context of the collection). Typically, personal data is collected to:
- register for certain areas of the site;
- subscribe to updates;
- enquire for further information;
- distribute requested reference materials;
- submit curriculum vitae;
- monitor and enforce compliance with our terms and conditions for use of our website;
- administer and manage our website, including confirming and authenticating identity and preventing unauthorised 
- access to restricted areas, premium content or other services limited to registered users; and
- aggregate data for website analytics and improvements.

Unless we are asked not to, we may also use your data to contact you with information about Rework-Space’s business, 
services and events, and other information which may be of interest to you. Should visitors subsequently choose to 
unsubscribe from mailing lists or any registrations, we will provide instructions on the appropriate webpage, in our 
communication to the individual, or the individual may contact us by email to complaint@rework-space.com.

Our websites do not collect or compile personal data for the dissemination or sale to outside parties for consumer 
marketing purposes or host mailings on behalf of third parties. If there is an instance where such information may be 
shared with a party that is not a Rework-Space member firm, the visitor will be asked for their consent beforehand.

### Legal basis for processing personal data

We will process personal data of visitors to our website based on our legitimate business interests or the consent, if 
the data subject has been requested to express one. For example, we have an interest in making sure our marketing is 
relevant for specified individuals, so we may process personal data to send our marketing that is tailored to the 
interests of a data subject.

### Data retention

Personal data collected via our websites will be retained by us for as long as it is necessary (e.g. for as long as we 
have a relationship with the relevant individual).

## Recruitment applicants

When applying online for a role at Rework-Space via the Rework-Space careers website, applicants should refer to the 
information made available when applying for a job for details about why and how personal data is collected and 
processed.

For more detail about our recruitment processes, please visit our [career page]({{< ref "/Careers" >}}).

## Legal basis for processing

Legal bases for each processing activity are specified in the relevant sections above. When we process  personal 
information for our legitimate interests, we make sure to consider and balance any potential impact on a data subject 
(both positive and negative), and the data subject’s rights under data protection laws. Our legitimate business 
interests do not automatically override interests of the data subjects - we will not process personal data for 
activities where our interests are overridden by the impact on the data subject  (unless we have the consent or are 
otherwise required or permitted to by law).

### When and how we share personal data and locations of processing

We will only share personal data with others when we are legally permitted to do so.  When we share data with others, 
we put contractual arrangements and security mechanisms in place to protect the data and to comply with our data 
protection, confidentiality and security standards.

We are part of a global network of firms and in common with other professional service providers, we use third parties 
located in other countries to help us run our business.  As a result, personal data may be transferred outside the 
countries where we and our clients are located.

In respect of personal data being regulated by EU legislation please note that: cross border transfers may include 
countries outside the European Economic Area ("EEA") and to countries that do not have laws that provide specific 
protection for personal data.   We have taken steps to ensure all personal data is provided with adequate protection 
and that all transfers of personal data outside the EEA are done lawfully.  Where we transfer personal data outside 
of the EEA to a country not determined by the European Commission as providing an adequate level of protection for 
personal data, the transfers will be under an agreement which covers the EU requirements for the transfer of personal 
data outside the EEA, such as the European Commission approved standard contractual clauses.  The European Commission 
approved standard contractual clauses are available 
[here](https://commission.europa.eu/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en).

Personal data held by us may be transferred to:
- Third party organisations that provide applications/functionality, data processing or IT services to us
- We use third parties to support us in providing our services and to help provide, run and manage our internal IT 
systems.  For example, providers of information technology, cloud based software as a service providers, identity 
management, website hosting and management, data analysis, data back-up, security and storage services.  The servers 
powering and facilitating that cloud infrastructure are located in secure data centres around the world, and personal 
data may be stored in any one of them.
- Third party organisations that otherwise assist us in providing goods, services or information
- Auditors and other professional advisers
- Law enforcement or other government and regulatory agencies or to other third parties as required by, and in 
accordance with, applicable law or regulation
- Occasionally, we may receive requests from third parties with authority to obtain disclosure of personal data, such 
as to check that we are complying with applicable law and regulation, to investigate an alleged crime, to establish, 
exercise or defend legal rights.  We will only fulfil requests for personal data where we are permitted to do so in 
accordance with applicable law or regulation.
