Every company understands the importance of efficient and fast information exchange. Often this exchange takes place
via e-mail or flash drives. By sending dozens of e-mails a day with attachments, employees do not have enough space to
store them. Such an inefficient data exchange system leads to duplication of files and rapid accumulation of such copies
on different devices.

Storing files in an unlimited space in the cloud solves space problems on employees' computers. Using cloud services,
employees can quickly and easily share a single copy of documents with each other and use unlimited space to store them.
This level of freedom gives businesses unlimited opportunities for growth.
