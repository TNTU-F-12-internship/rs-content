When data is stored in different places, important files are sometimes lost or difficult to find. Sometimes there are
situations when several employees work with one document. Several versions of the same file undergo different additional
changes, which makes them unequal and complicates further work. Such situations require additional time to compile all
copies into one current version.

Using cloud services to store files allows you to realize the benefits of sharing. Employees can access the required
documents from any device and at any time. File editors are available in both the browser and mobile applications.
This enables real-time collaboration, speeds up tasks, and simplifies internal communication.
