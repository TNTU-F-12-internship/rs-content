It is important for every business to block the ability to log in outside the organization. To do this, you need to
increase the reliability and security of e-mail, in particular through tracking and detection of suspicious logins.
At the same time, companies often use different incompatible tools, which further complicates the process of setting
up access.

Special administrator settings in the integrated desktop allow you to block access to files outside the organization.
One administrator has complete control over the accounts and this saves a lot of time for the technical department.
The administrator can also easily control password strength, user activity, and give employees access to specific files.
Such a system is managed centrally and at the same time accessible to workers who work around the globe and have access
to the Internet.
