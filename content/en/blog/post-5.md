### {{< color-text text="Cooperative education model on the go! (Rework-Space + TNTU case)" >}}

3-5 of November 2023
{{< color-link link_title="the 6th international Cassini Hackathon" path="https://www.cassini.eu/hackathons/" >}} 
brought together students, researchers, entrepreneurs from 
across Europe to apply their skills and knowledge in data science and data engineering in a very special field. 
Participating teams undertook development of digital applications based on satellite imaging data, collected by 
Copernicus European Union's Earth observation programme.

We are pleased to mark the milestone - this year, for the first time Ukrainian participants joined the hackathon! One 
of the teams was led by Roman Gashynskyi, 4th year student of Ternopil Ivan Puluj National Technical University, who 
currently does his bachelor studies  in computer sciences at TNTU and Rework-Space within the cooperative education 
programme. Among his teammates were Ivan Osiichuk, also a cooperative education fellow doing his master studies at 
TNTU and Rework-Space; Yaroslav Mashtaliar, 4th year student of Ivan Franko National University of Lviv; TNTU student 
Nazarii Melnyk as well as TNTU alumnus Aser Kashosi. The StellOracle project was also supported by TNTU researchers 
Vitaly Brevus and Yuriy Skorenkyy.

The team developed a data-based project aimed at enhancing safety of critical infrastructure in regions affected by 
natural disasters or conflicts, to address the challenge of Supporting sustainable infrastructure development.
