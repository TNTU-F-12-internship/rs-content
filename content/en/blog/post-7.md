From November 22-24, 2024, innovators across Europe came together for the
{{< color-link link_title="EU Space for Defence and Security CASSINI Hackathon" path="https://taikai.network/en/cassinihackathons/hackathons/euspace-defence-security/overview" target="_blank" >}} –
an initiative powered by the European Union to leverage space technologies for next-generation defence and security 
solutions. This high-impact event challenged teams of entrepreneurs, engineers, and data scientists to create scalable 
applications using Copernicus satellite data and EU space infrastructure.

At 
{{< color-link link_title="Rework-Space" path="https://rework-space.com" target="_blank" >}},
we believe in the transformative potential of AI, data engineering, and real-time analytics in critical 
infrastructure and emergency response. Implementing this vision, our team developed
{{< color-link link_title="DroneSight" path="https://taikai.network/cassinihackathons/hackathons/euspace-defence-security/projects/cm2yk8hgq03y9bsslwti7fzjd/idea" target="_blank" >}} –
a precision intelligence platform for drone-based hazard detection and risk assessment in maritime and riverine 
environments.

DroneSight fuses satellite imaging (Copernicus) with drone-collected data to deliver near-real-time monitoring for 
enhanced safety operations. This integration is enabled through our proprietary
{{< color-link link_title="QueryOptima" path="https://rework-space.com/blog/2024-10-04-queryoptima-revolutionizing-data-optimization-and-bi-integration" target="_blank" >}}
 data fusion engine, which ingests data from
{{< color-link link_title="OpenEO APIs" path="https://dataspace.copernicus.eu/analyse/openeo" target="_blank" >}}
 and various open-source geospatial repositories, normalizing and enriching it into actionable intelligence.

We use Sentinel-1 SAR, Sentinel-2, and drone data with the
{{< color-link link_title="YOLOv11" path="https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics" target="_blank" >}}
 model and MarinexT framework to detect ships and identify hazards like marine debris and oil spills, etc. Also, we use
{{< color-link link_title="MyShipTracking" path="https://www.myshiptracking.com" target="_blank" >}}
 AIS to obtain real-time ship data. After that we use our solution QueryOptima to normalize and structure the data and 
Blue Brain Nexus to embed it into a knowledge graph. Processed data is used for risk assessment, identification of safe 
routes and further visualization to assure timely and informed decision making.

Our data engineering pipeline supports:
* Multi-source ingestion and harmonization.
* Event-driven AI analytics for real-time alerting.
* Optimized cloud-native architecture for scalability.

This solution positions DroneSight as a valuable tool in supporting EU-wide emergency response efforts and 
environmental monitoring initiatives.

a forward-thinking urban innovation lab based in Ivano-Frankivsk. Known for catalyzing educational, social, and 
technological projects, Metalab provided a dynamic environment for ideation and rapid development. Their mission to 
foster sustainable innovation aligns perfectly with our own vision: to apply cutting-edge AI and data infrastructure 
to complex, real-world problems.
